# Feed Reader
Udacity provided the feedreader application and I had to write some tests to against it.

### Installation
In terminal run `$ git clone https://github.com/johnkmeas/feedreader.github.io.git`

### Run
Open index.html and scroll to bottom to see test results

### feedreader.js
Open feedreader.js to see the test suites I've written. 

### Thoughts on this project

I look forward to more Test Driven Development. I like the idea of constructing test suites to help focus the development.
