# Feed Reader
Udacity provided the feedreader application and I had to write some tests run against it.

#### How to run this application
In terminal run `$ git clone https://github.com/johnkmeas/feedreader.github.io.git`

#### Open in Browser
Open index.html and scroll to bottom to see test results

### feedreader.js
Open feedreader.js to see the test suites that I've written.

### Thoughts on this project

I look forward to more Test Driven Development. With Javascript testing, I feel I can approach development feeling confident in a solid and bug free application.

## Skills

- Understand Test Driven Development using a Jasmine.js.
