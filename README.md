# Feed Reader
Udacity provided the feedreader application and I had to write some tests run against it.

#### How to run this application
In terminal run `$ git clone https://github.com/johnkmeas/feedreader.github.io.git`

#### Open in Browser
Open index.html and scroll to bottom to see test results

### feedreader.js
Open feedreader.js to see the test suites that I've written.

### Thoughts on this project

I look forward to more Test Driven Development. I like how constructing test suites can build my confidence in  developing solid and bug free application.

## Skills

- Learned to Test Driven Development use a Jasmine.js.
